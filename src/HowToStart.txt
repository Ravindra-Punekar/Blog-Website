Create a Netlify account and create a new site.
Connect your GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository to Netlify.
In your project's repository, create a file called .env. This file will contain your environment variables, such as the port numbers for your frontend and backend.
REACT_APP_PORT=3000
JSON_DATABASE_PORT=8000
In your project's repository, create a file called netlify.toml. This file will contain the configuration settings for your Netlify deployment.
[build]
command = "npm run build"
publish = "dist"

[functions]
# The port number for your backend
port = 5000

# The URL of your backend
backend_url = "http://localhost:8000"
In your project's repository, add the following line to your package.json file:
"scripts": {
"start": "npm run build && npm run start:client && npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000"
}

This will tell Netlify to run the json-server command when you deploy your project.

Push your changes to your repository. Netlify will automatically deploy your project.
Once you have deployed your project, you can access the frontend on the following URL:

https://<your-project-name>.netlify.app/
And you can access the backend on the following URL:

http://<your-project-name>.netlify.app:5000/
